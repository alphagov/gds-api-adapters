A set of API adapters to work with the GDS APIs, extracted from the frontend
app.

Example usage:

    publisher_api = GdsApi::Publisher.new("environment")
    ostruct_publication = publisher.publication_for_slug('my-published-item')

    panopticon_api = GdsApi::Panopticon.new("environment")
    ostruct_metadata = panopticon_api.artefact_for_slug('my-published-item')

Very much still a work in progress.

## Logging

Each HTTP request can be logged as JSON. Example:

    {
      "request_uri":"http://contactotron.platform/contacts/1",
      "start_time":1324035128.9056342,
      "status":"success",
      "end_time":1324035129.2017104
    }


By default we log to a NullLogger since we don't want to pollute your test
results or logs. To log output you'll want to set `GdsApi::Base.logger` to
something that actually logs:

    GdsApi::Base.logger = Logger.new("/path/to/file.log")

## Authorization

The API Adapters currently support either HTTP Basic authentication or OAuth2
(bearer token) authorization. This is only used for Panopticon registration at
present. The GdsApi::Panopticon::Registerer adapter expects a constant called
PANOPTICON_API_CREDENTIALS to be defined and will use that to pass the relevant
options to the HTTP client.

To use bearer token authorization the format that constant should be a hash of
the form:

    PANOPTICON_API_CREDENTIALS = { bearer_token: 'MY_BEARER_TOKEN' }


## Middleware for request tracing

We set a unique header at the cache level called `GOVUK-Request-Id`. In order
to serve a user's request, if apps make API requests they should pass on this
header, so that we can trace a request across the entire GOV.UK stack.

`GdsApi::GovukRequestIdSniffer` middleware takes care of this. This gem contains
a railtie that configures this middleware for Rails apps without extra effort.
Other Rack-based apps should opt-in by adding this line to your `config.ru`:

```use GdsApi::GovukRequestIdSniffer```


## Test Helpers

There are also test helpers for stubbing various requests in other apps.
Example usage of the panopticon helper:

In `test_helper.rb`:

    require 'gds_api/test_helpers/panopticon'

    class ActiveSupport::TestCase
      include GdsApi::TestHelpers::Panopticon
    end

In the test:

    panopticon_has_metadata('id' => 12345, 'need_id' => need.id,
      'slug' => 'my_slug')

### Dependencies

Some of the helpers come with additional dependencies that you'll need to
have installed and configured in your consuming app/lib.

At time of writing, these are:

* [WebMock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock)

## To Do

* Make timeout handling work
