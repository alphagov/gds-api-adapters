Potentially backwards-incompatible changes:

* The `disable_timeout` option has been removed.
* `JsonClient` now respects the `Expires` headers when caching results.  If no `Expires` header is set, the global cache TTL will be used (defaults to 15 mins).
* The Rummager client now inherits from `GdsApi::Base`.  This means that it uses `JsonClient` and therefore inherits its timeout and caching behaviour.

Other changes:

* Added Worldwide API client.
