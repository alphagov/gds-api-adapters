  README.

# 28.1.1

  which stubs the Publishing API V2 to return the links payload which is supplied
  as the arg.

# 28.0.1

* In `TestHelpers::PublishingApiV2` - for methods that accept an optional arg
  `attributes_or_matcher`, change the default value to nil so that we don't test
  for request body if the argument is not supplied.
* In the same class, fix `#publishing_api_has_fields_for_format` so that we
  always cast the `item` arg to Array. This correctly handles cases where only
  one item is passed in.

  (`request_json_matching` predicate).

Potentially backwards-incompatible changes:

* The `disable_timeout` option has been removed.
* `JsonClient` now respects the `Expires` headers when caching results.  If no `Expires` header is set, the global cache TTL will be used (defaults to 15 mins).
* The Rummager client now inherits from `GdsApi::Base`.  This means that it uses `JsonClient` and therefore inherits its timeout and caching behaviour.

Other changes:

* Added Worldwide API client.
