  better reflect the behaviour. Also rename related test_helper methods.

# 28.3.1

* Fixed `TestHelpers::Imminence` missing `end`.

# 28.3.0

* `TestHelpers::Imminence` now has `imminence_has_places_for_postcode` and
  `stub_imminence_places_request` helper methods. There was previously no helper
  for the find places with post code tools. It is now possible to stub all requests
  for places with any status code or payload as required.

# 28.2.1

* `TestHelpers::PublishingApiV2` now has a `publishing_api_does_not_have_links` test helper
  which stubs the Publishing API V2 to return the 404 payload for the `content_id` passed
  as the arg.

# 28.2.0

* Pass the Govuk-Original-Url header on to requests made by gds-api-adapters,
  similarly to the existing Govuk-Request-Id header.  Rails applications will
  get this support automatically when using this version of gds-api-adapters.
  Other applications will need to add an explicit call to `use
  GdsApi::GovukHeaderSniffer, 'HTTP_GOVUK_ORIGINAL_URL"`, as detailed in the
  README.

# 28.1.1

# 28.0.2

  as the arg.

# 28.0.1

* In `TestHelpers::PublishingApiV2` - for methods that accept an optional arg
  `attributes_or_matcher`, change the default value to nil so that we don't test
  for request body if the argument is not supplied.
* In the same class, fix `#publishing_api_has_fields_for_format` so that we
  always cast the `item` arg to Array. This correctly handles cases where only
  one item is passed in.

# 23.1.0

* GdsApi::TestHelpers::PublishingApi

  added the ability to make more flexible assertions about publishing api
  requests by optionally passing a predicate to the assertions. The
  `request_json_including` predicate will match required elements of a hash or
  a nested hash in the JSON body.

  The existing stricter behaviour is retained as the default
  (`request_json_matching` predicate).

Potentially backwards-incompatible changes:

* `JsonClient` now respects the `Expires` headers when caching results.  If no `Expires` header is set, the global cache TTL will be used (defaults to 15 mins).
* The Rummager client now inherits from `GdsApi::Base`.  This means that it uses `JsonClient` and therefore inherits its timeout and caching behaviour.

Other changes:

* Added Worldwide API client.
